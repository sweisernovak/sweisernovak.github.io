          <p >Here be chemistry. Don't forget your PPE. Maybe some live cell imaging protocols one day. <!-- Aldehyde fixation. Staining with osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate, Walton's lead aspartate, sodium cacodylate. Solvent dehydration. For structural imaging, epoxy resins to consider: Spurrs, Eponate, Durcupan. Alternatively, AFS for conjugate array tomography or immunogold using acrylic resins. --> </p>
